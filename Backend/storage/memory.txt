Query: What is a CNF?
Response: Hey Aarush, a CNF, or Conjunctive Normal Form, is a way of representing Boolean algebra formulas. Basically, it's a conjunction – that means "and" – of one or more clauses. Think of it as a bunch of “and” statements all linked together to represent a logical expression. It’s commonly used in things like SAT solvers and simplifying context-free grammars!
